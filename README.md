# Hi, Iâ€™m David Ocholi â€” A Data Enthusiast | IT Professional | Growth-Oriented Analyst

## Education & Background
Building on a strong foundation in Industrial Mathematics and a Master's degree in Computer & Information Technology (CIT) in view, I've developed a unique blend of analytical acumen and technical expertise. Throughout my career, I've successfully managed large-scale digital systems, provided critical support for high-level decision-making, and spearheaded projects that drive organizational efficiency. My passion for data science stems from its transformative potential to uncover insights, inform strategic decisions, and solve complex problems. I'm committed to harnessing the power of data to drive business growth and innovation. 

## My Data Learning Journey
To transition into the data space, Iâ€™ve been hands-on with:

â€¢	Real-world projects and case studies

â€¢	Learning platforms and certifications

Iâ€™ve learned to extract, clean, transform, analyze, and visualize data using modern tools and techniques, and I continue to challenge myself with diverse datasets to improve and apply these skills.

Whether working independently or in a collaborative environment, I enjoy finding patterns in data and turning them into actionable insights that matter.
