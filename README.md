# Hi, Iâ€™m David Ocholi â€” Data Enthusiast | IT Professional | Growth-Oriented Analyst

With over 5 years of experience in IT infrastructure management, technical support, project coordination, and executive support & operations. I am now channeling my skills into the dynamic world of Data Analytics.

## Background
I hold a bachelor's degree in Industrial Mathematics, which sharpened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills and I'm rounding up a master's degree in Computer & Information Technology (CIT), aimed at broadening my theoretical & practical knowledge of IT. Over the years, Iâ€™ve managed large-scale digital systems, supported high-level decision-making, and coordinated projects that improve organizational efficiency. My interest in data grew as I realized the immense power it has to solve problems, inform strategy and drive smarter decisions.

## My Data Learning Journey
To transition into the data space, Iâ€™ve been hands-on with:

â€¢	Real-world projects and case studies

â€¢	Learning platforms and certifications

â€¢	Continuous personal projects using raw datasets

Iâ€™ve learned to extract, clean, transform, analyze, and visualize data using modern tools and techniques, and I continue to challenge myself with diverse datasets to improve and apply these skills.

Whether working independently or in a collaborative environment, I enjoy finding patterns in data and turning them into actionable insights that matter.
